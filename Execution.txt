In your project you have **two folders**:

1. **Backend (Flask + ML)** – runs the AI logic
2. **Frontend (React UI)** – runs the website

Both must run **at the same time** in **two terminals**.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Run the Backend (Flask)

1. Open **Command Prompt / PowerShell**
2. Go to your backend folder (where `api.py` is):

```bash
cd C:\Users\MALLELA SUPRIYA\OneDrive\Desktop\healthcare-chatbot
```

3. Run the backend:

```bash
python api.py
```

You should see something like:

```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

**Keep this terminal open.**
This is your AI server.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Run the Frontend (React)

1. Open **another Command Prompt / PowerShell** (new window)
2. Go to your React project:

```bash
cd C:\Users\MALLELA SUPRIYA\OneDrive\Desktop\healthcare-ui
```

3. Start React:

```bash
npm start
```

It will open in the browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
